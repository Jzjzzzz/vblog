    > Great work with the showdown library! I just used it and it worked exactly the way I expected 
      (given a complex inline HTML inside the Markdown, which renders fine with other viewers). 
      The other libraries I've tried (markdown-it and marked) produced a lot of bogus output. Y
      our library saved me at least half a day, thanks! Good luck :)

    > Thanks for the great work on showdown.js! I've been looking for a good solution to serve wiki-like text to a browser and render as
    HTML but nearly gave up after mixed success with wikitext. Your library gets me very close to where I want to be.
